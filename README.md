Encode
===========================================================================

Just a "hide that pics I wouldn't show to anyone" short program.
Yep, short program, I really refuse to call it a Script.

Hide that "I hope my mom doesn't see this" pictures and that
"OMG, nobody can know I like this" musics.

Usage
-----
As simple as type some words in the terminal...

###Encode:
`python encode.py file.txt devotchka e`

###Decode:
`python encode.py file.txt devotchka d`

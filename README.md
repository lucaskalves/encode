Encode
===========================================================================

Just a "hide that pics I wouldn't show to anyone" short program.
Yep, short program, I really refuse to call it a Script.

Hide that "I hope my mom doesn't see this" pictures and that
"OMG, nobody can know I like this" musics.

Usage
-----
As simple as type some words in the terminal...

`python encode.py <filename> <password> <way>`

Where:
* filename is the the file you want to encode or decode
* password is a super secret key used to crypt the data and after to decode
* way can be e (for encode) or d (for decode). It tells what you need to
do with the file.

###Encode:
`python encode.py file.txt devotchka e`

###Decode:
`python encode.py file.txt devotchka d`
